Setting Up Chef Server
Open an account on CHEF Manage
This will be your hosted server for CHEF
Site Link: https://manage.opscode.com
Creating a WorkStation
Provision an ubuntu vm on aws/azure
Open Link: https://docs.chef.io/workstation/install_workstation/
Head over to Linux Docs Part
Copy those two commands for Debian/Ubuntu one by one and run on vm
Run These Commands
sudo apt update

wget https://packages.chef.io/files/stable/chef-workstation/21.2.278/ubuntu/20.04/chef-workstation_21.2.278-1_amd64.deb

sudo dpkg -i chef-workstation_21.2.278-1_amd64.deb

Verify Installation
chef -v
Connecting workstation with CHEF Server
Head over to CHEF Manage Server
Select the Adminstration Tab
On Actions select 'Starter Kit'
Download the starter kit on local system
UnZip that File
Then copy the unzipped File into the workstation
Make sure you have the .pem file in the same folder from where u want to copy a file
scp -r -i "awskeypair.pem" chef-repo/ ubuntu@ec2-3-12-36-226.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/
Copy the .pem file to that folder and make sure the path to be pasted in is correct
scp -r -i "awskeypair.pem" awskeypair.pem ubuntu@ec2-3-12-36-226.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/chef-repo
These all steps will help to communicate workstation and server

Use this cmd for verifying ssl configuration for the CHEF Infra Server (Run this from the chef-repo directory)

knife ssl check
Bootstrap a node (From workstation)
Create two node vms on aws/azure and tag them as Node1 and node2
Remember to add the inbound access for HTTP 80 in the sec groups of both nodes
knife bootstrap <public ip address of node> --ssh-user ubuntu --sudo --ssh-identity-file awskeypair.pem -N <node name>
Head over to CHEF Server
Click on Nodes Tab
You will be able to see the node list
Link: https://docs.chef.io/install_bootstrap/ (Not So Imp)
Some ad-hoc commands
knife node list

knife node show <Node Name>
Creating a Sample CookBook (From Workstation)
Either create a cookbook inside 'cookbooks folder' or create a new directory and create cookbooks inside them
Run the below command to create cookbook inside chef-repo/cookbooks
chef generate cookbook <cookbook name>
Sample Scripts inside recipe directory :
(You can create your own .rb recipe file or else use default.rb file)

Script1 to install Apache Server
package 'apache2'  do
  action :install
end
file '/var/www/html/index.html' do
  content '<html>This is a placeholder for the home page.</html>'
  action :create
end
service 'apache2' do
  action [:enable,:start]
end
Script2 to install Nginx Server
package 'nginx' do
 action :install
end
service 'nginx' do
 action [:enable,:start]
end
NOTE: You can change versions of cookbooks in metadata.rb in your cookbook folder if required
Chef Cookbook Recipe Tutorial for beginners
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY6xg7CI5Xw&list=PLsgnv1SN76IJIiBg0e1lAIIAW1xZXPHF1&index=4

Uploading a CookBook (From WorkStation)
For Syntax Check of ruby script
chef exec ruby -c recipes/default.rb
Command to push CookBook (Always work from chef-repo folder)
If cookbooks are present inside default folder 'cookbooks'
knife cookbook upload -a

OR

knife cookbook upload simplecookbook

If cookbooks are present in user created folders then specifying path is mandatory for uploading
knife cookbook upload --cookbook-path ~/chef-repo/democook/ -a

OR

knife cookbook upload --cookbook-path ~/chef-repo/democook/ simplecookbook

Add the cookbook to the Node's Run List
knife node run_list add Node1 recipe[<cookbook name>::<ruby file name inside recipe>]

Ex:
knife node run_list add Node1 recipe[simplecookbook::default]

Once added then all future pushes of cookbooks will automatically update in the run list of the node.
Note: You dont have to specifically run this command and again
Creating Attributes
Create a folder named attributes inside the cookbook you are working with. NOTE: make sure recipes and attributes folder are on same directory structure
create a default attribute file: default.rb
default['<cookbook_name>']['<variable_name>'] = '<value>'
EX:

default['samplecookbook']['env']= 'default'
default['samplecookbook']['name']= 'nobody'
Add these attributes on recipe's default.rb file
var1 = node['<cookbook_name>']['<attribute_variable_name>']
var2 = node['<cookbook_name>']['<attribute_variable_name>']
Sample Recipe Example:

var1 = node['samplecookbook']['env']
var2 = node['samplecookbook']['name']
package 'apache2'  do
  action :install
end
file '/var/www/html/index.html' do
  content "<html>This is a placeholder for the #{var1} #{var2} page..!</html>"
  action :create
end
service 'apache2' do
  action [:enable,:start]
end

Upload the cookbook after adding attributes
Working with Environments
Refer Link: https://docs.chef.io/environments/

Create an evironments directory in chef-repo directory
mkdir environments
cd environments
Create a .json or .rb file inside the environments directory
For Development (dev.json)
{
   "name": "development",
   "description": "",
   "cookbook_versions": {
           "<cookbook_name>": "= <cookbook_version>"
   },
   "json_class": "Chef::Environment",
   "chef_type": "environment",
   "default_attributes": {
   },
   "override_attributes": {
           "<cookbook_name>": {
                "env": "development",
                "name": "Isha"
           }
   }
}
Run This Command to update Environemnet :
knife environments from file dev.json
For Production (prod.json)
{
   "name": "production",
   "description": "",
   "cookbook_versions": {
           "samplecookbook": "= <cookbook_version>"
   },
   "json_class": "Chef::Environment",
   "chef_type": "environment",
   "default_attributes": {
   },
   "override_attributes": {
           "samplecookbook": {
                "env": "production",
                "name": "Atib"
           }
   }
}
Run This Command to update Environemnet from environments directory:
knife environments from file prod.json
Select the environment from the CHEF Manage Site manually for each node

Click on Node > Details Tab > Environment Menu

Select first node for Development and save it.

Select second node for Production and save it.

After Updating Environments run this from dev and prod nodes cli

sudo chef-client
Open browser and put :80 and put :80 in two tabs
check the results.
Some adhoc commands
knife environment list
